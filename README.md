The Walrus Approved Invoice Generator. So simple a walrus could use it!

The generator uses basic invoice templates and configuration files to generate fancy PDF invoices.

Dependencies
------------

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org)
- [JSON](json.org)
- [Pystache](https://github.com/defunkt/pystache)

My main focus will be to generate swedish invoice templates as this is my native language. Support for english invoices will be added later on.
