The Walrus Approved Invoice Generator. So simple a walrus could use it!

The generator will use basic invoice templates and configuration files to generate PDF invoices.

The templates will written in HTML, generation scripts in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org) and the configuration files in [JSON](json.org).

My main focus will be to generate swedish invoice templates as this is my native language. Support for english invoices will be added later on.
